## About
Barclays Premier League (BPL) is an English professional league for men's football association clubs.It is contested by 20 clubs and operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League. Fantasy Premier League (FPL) is a game in which participants assemble an imaginary team of real-time footballers and score points based on those players actual statistical performance or their perceived contribution on the field of play. 

The primary objective of the project is to extract a story out of the dataset to help Barclays Premier League Organization and Football Clubs understand the factors that influence the players market value and to help the Fantasy League players to choose the right players in their team. The story contains descriptive analysis using various statistical visualizations of variables in the dataset.
